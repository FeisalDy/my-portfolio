The Design System Accelerator project delivers the tooling and documentation needed for teams to build consistent frontends without slowing down delivery. I architected a reusable component library with thematic design tokens, cross-framework support, and automated documentation.

### Highlights

- Implemented a token-first architecture with synchronized Figma styles and code exports.
- Automated release workflows with semantic versioning and Storybook visual baselines.
- Reduced onboarding time for new engineers by bundling examples, guidelines, and lint rules.

### Stack & Responsibilities

- Next.js App Router for documentation site and interactive API playgrounds.
- Tailwind CSS with design tokens compiled from a single source of truth.
- Custom lint rules and templates to enforce accessibility standards.

The outcome was a unified experience across three product lines and a 40% reduction in UI-related regressions.
