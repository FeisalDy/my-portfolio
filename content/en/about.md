## Hello, I’m Feisal Dharma Yuda

I craft user-focused experiences as a frontend developer with a systems mindset. My work bridges design and engineering, ensuring every interface is usable, accessible, and scalable.

## What I Do

- **Frontend engineering:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and component-driven architectures.
- **Backend support:** Node.js, REST APIs, and serverless functions when the project calls for an end-to-end solution.
- **Architecture & system design:** I explore how features fit together, modelling data flows and defining clear boundaries to keep systems maintainable.

## Development Philosophy

Clean, maintainable, and scalable code is the backbone of every deliverable. I focus on:

1. **Clarity:** Self-documenting code, purposeful abstractions, and thoughtful naming.
2. **Performance:** Lean bundles, fast load times, and smooth interactions.
3. **Reliability:** Automated checks, consistent patterns, and testable modules.

## Experience & Education
